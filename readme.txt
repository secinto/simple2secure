- Use the keystores in src/main/resources/keystores for Probe and Portal either by importing the 
  certificate as administrator into the common cacerts of Java. NOT RECOMMENDED
  
  keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias {something} -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -file {path_to_certificate file}	
  
  OR better by using the cacerts keystore in the src/main/resources/keys with System properties as start parameters. 
  
  In eclipse you can enter the VM arguments for the RUN/DEBUG configuration like
  
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<path_to_cacerts> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<password>
  
  e.g.
  
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=D:/development/simple2secure/simple2secure.portal/src/main/resources/keys/cacerts -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=testtest
  
  Additionally it will be necessary for chrome to enable the following flag. Insert this in the address bar and set it to 
  enabled. 
	
	chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost 
	
  For firefox it is necessary to surf to https://localhost:8443/ and create an exception by downloading the certificate and trusting
  it manually. Thereafter it works.
