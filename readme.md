# simple2secure installation instructions
You can make your own local build and host the portal, testservice, web and so on locally.

Prerequisites:

- Java 8, Gradle (min. 4.6)
- Tested with Eclipse IDE (with Spring Suite, JavaFX Plugin)
- MongoDB 
- Python (3.7), Pip, NodeJS (Latest LTS), Redis
- In order that the tests can be run it is required that any Virus scanner is muted, since they usually block sending Emails directly

or you can use our BETA portal https://simple2secure.info:51003/#/ (currently not available).

### General remark:

If you have a virus scanner running on your machine it is required that you either postpone it or you make an exception for the portal (Java task).
This is necessary in order to guarantee correct execution of the simple2secure.portal since it tries to send emails if required which can fail 
depending on the virus scanner used. 

## simple2secure.portal
1) Download and install MongoDB Community Edition
2) Start mongodb by running "mongod" command from the shell
3) Download and install gradle from from https://gradle.org/releases/
3) Navigate to the simple2secure root folder and run "gradle eclipse"
4) Open project in eclipse and you can run it directly from the eclipse IDE

## simple2secure.web
1) Download and install NodeJS (verified with 10.16.3 LTS) from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2) Run "npm install" from the simple2secure.web directory
3) install Angular CLI by executing "npm install -g @angular/cli" from the command line
4) After everything is installed successfully you can start the web by executing "start.bat" batch file from the simple2secure.web directory 

## simple2secure.testservice (Pod)

For development it is easiest to use the Pod directly and not within a Docker container, since it is easier to modify things. 
Therefore, some tools are required to be installed. The Pod uses Celery (Distributed Task Queue) for managing its different tasks
which itself requires a third part Message Queue provider such as RabbitMQ, Redis or others. We have based your solution on Redis 
and depending on whether you are developing on Windows or Linux it must be installed for this system. Find below the installation 
instructions for the different OS.

### Installation of Redis 

#### WINDOWS
Download and install redis as windows service from:
https://github.com/downloads/rgl/redis/redis-2.4.6-setup-64-bit.exe

#### LINUX
1) sudo apt-get update
2) sudo apt-get upgrade
3) sudo apt-get install redis-server
4) sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service

### Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

## #Start python application
python app.py

### Start celery worker from the console (Open console and type)
celery -A src.celery.celery_tasks.celery worker --loglevel=info

## General info on the portal and the pod

Here it is described how to activate and run the Pod using our server but it would be the same (except that you need to use localhost:9000 
instead of simple2secure.info:51003).

Activating and running the pod from our server (currently in maintenance mode - will be announced as soon as it has been updated to current release version)

1) Visit our portal at https://simple2secure.info:51003 and register if you do not have an account

2) Activate an account and download license from the "My Groups" tab under the following link https://simple2secure.info:51003/#/user

3) Copy this license file in the /static/license/ folder

4) Check in config.py file if the parameter PORTAL_URL is set to the "https://simple2secure.info:51001/s2s/api"

5) After that install all required libraries by executing pip install -r requirements.txt from the root folder of our testservice project

6) When all libraries are installed you can start the project by running python app.py
```
