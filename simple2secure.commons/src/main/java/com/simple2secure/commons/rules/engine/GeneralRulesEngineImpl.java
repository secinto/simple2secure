 *         Implementation for a rule engine for different use cases.
 * 
 *         For the engine is the easy-rules library (https://github.com/j-easy/easy-rules) Version 3.3.0 used.
 * 
 *         You can add and remove rules. A rule must have a condition and an action. If the the condition is satisfied the action will be
 *         performed.
 * 
 *         You can add and remove Facts, each rule will be used on each fact.
